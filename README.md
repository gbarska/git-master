# Basic Commands

Git basics 

## Initial changes

### git status

Displays repository status

### git add

Adds files to the staging area

### git commit -m "First file in demo repo"

Commit changes with -m message

### git commit -am "First file in demo repo"

Adds all modified files to the staging area and  Commits changes with -m message 

similar to git add . + git commit -m


### rm -rf .git

Removes git files 

### git init
 
Initializes git  on existing project folder

### git log 

Logs all commits that are part of a Repository

### git show

Display the commit changes along with the diffs

### git ls-files

List all files tracked by the repository so far

## Backing Out changes

### git reset HEAD

Backs out commited changes to the staging area but keep the modifications on the working directory

### git checkout

Discard canges entirely and restore to the last status as the repository

```
git checkout --README.md
```


## Git Alias

### git config

Creates alias for specified git commands && parameters

```
git config --global alias.hist "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"
```

Hint: list all configs created:

```
git config --global --list
```
 
## Removing and renaming files


### git mv 

Renames (moves*) files

```
git mv example.txt demo.txt 

git commit -m "renaming file"
```

The file name would be changed even though it was renamed after the  git add command

### git rm

Removes the staged file and tracks the change


Ps: if files were modified outside git (without git mv or git rm ) then git will miss that real change, ex:

mv example.txt newname.txt 

git status > git would consider example as deleted and newname as a new file 

to fix:

git add -A 

## git diff 

Shows diference between two commits or branches 

```
git diff 

or

git diff d444e90 HEAD

or 

git diff updates master
```

ps: HEAD -> last commit at current branch

## git branch

### git branch

List current branch

### create new branch with checkou command

Creates a new branch called updates based on master 

```
git checkout -b updates
```


### git checkout

Switches the current branch 

```
git checkout master
```


### git fetch

The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.

```
git fetch
```

ps:  it doesnâ€™t force you to actually merge the changes into your repository. 


look at the remote repository for dead branches and removes reference if any, very useful after 

git branch -d 

```
git fetch -P  

```

### git merge

Merge branches to the master when master has no change pending compared to child branches

### remove branch

git branch -d name_of_branch

## GIT TAGGING

### git tag tagname

### git tag -d tagname

### git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"

Adds optional comment and version, useful to create a baseline 


## SAVING WORK IN PROGRESS WITH STASH

new changes and after that continue your work

### git stash list

### git stash pop

### git reset c22s2si2 (commit id) --mixed (*default option)
